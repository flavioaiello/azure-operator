# CVE-2023-45853 - zlib MiniZip integer overflow
# =============================================================================
# Package: zlib1g (1:1.2.13.dfsg-1)
# Severity: CRITICAL
# Status: FALSE POSITIVE
#
# JUSTIFICATION:
# This CVE affects MiniZip (contrib/minizip), which is a SEPARATE component
# that is NOT compiled into Debian's zlib1g binary package.
#
# Evidence from Debian Security Tracker:
# - https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45853
# - "[bookworm] - zlib <ignored> (contrib/minizip not built and src:zlib not
#    producing binary packages)"
#
# The vulnerable code path (zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64) only exists in minizip,
# which is built from src:minizip, not src:zlib. The zlib1g package in our
# distroless base image does NOT contain this code.
#
# Debian's minizip package (src:minizip) IS patched: 1.1-8+deb12u1
#
# REVIEWED: 2026-01-15
# REVIEWER: Security audit during v0.1.0 release
